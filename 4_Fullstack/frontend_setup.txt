First we create a client folder with:
NOTE: create-react-app is no longer recommended by React
npx create-react-app client --use-npm
  npx create-next-app client --use-npm

Now we can
npm run dev

Now normally we could fetch to
http://127.0.0.1:5555/path
but we can simpify this with adding this to package.json
"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5555" (IF NOT USING NEXT)
also make sure we are running our client on a different port
"scripts": {
  "start": "PORT=4000 react-scripts start"
}
Now make sure to do an npm start in the client folder

Now we can go ahead and test 
get
fetch("/route")
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data));

post
fetch("/route", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
